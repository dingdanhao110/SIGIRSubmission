#CLING-GS

minibatched version of CLING based on the fork of graphsage:

### graphsage

`pytorch` version of https://github.com/williamleif/GraphSAGE

There are also a handful of new features, including:
  - scripts for preprocessing data
  - attention-based aggregator
  - sparse edge sampler (eg, don't use the dense 2D edgelist)
  - richer, pluggable preprocessing classes

This version is missing some features, as well.  Namely:
  - we don't support unsupervised models (yet)

A simplified version of the original Tensorflow version can be found on branch `tf-simple`.
